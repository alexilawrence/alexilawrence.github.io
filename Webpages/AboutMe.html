				Hello! I am Alexi, a student from TJC's class of 2023. I am in 04/22 (aka the computing class), and take PXME (Physics, Computing, Mathematics, Economics), 
				all at the H2 level. I do take H3 Economics too! Outside of the classroom, I am the president of the TJ Choir, and am also a part of the Organising 
				Committee for the DEFY Camp. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Outside of the classroom, my interests lie in cooking, cycling, rugby and football, along with finding out more about the world due to my inquisitive nature. Many regard
				me as somewhat of a polymath (albeit I might not have extensive knowledge about most fields). You could say that I'm a jack of all trades, but master of none.
				But then again, that is better than being the master of one right? I do also enjoy listening to a wide range of music ranging from classics such as Pachelbel's 
				Canon to choral pieces like Carlos Fonseca's Jubiaba or Eriks Esenvalds' Stars, musicals like Hadestown(my personal favourite), Les Miserables or Moulin Rouge and 
				pop/rock. 
			</p>

				Regarding my future aspirations, I am not very certain of what I want to pursue. Currently I am looking into finance, the economy, IT or physics related jobs, 
				but given the ever changing global climate, it has been difficult for me to decide on a specific one. My current objective is to find a job that would allow me to have more free time,
				or find a way to earn steady streams of passive income to allow me to retire from office jobs earlier, so that I can pursue my hobbies. I'd love to be able to get a fully-kitted out 
				kitchen for me to experiment with different dishes and flavours, or to make my own little workshop to do woodwork or metal work. A dream would also be to travel 
				the world to visit different historical places, experience different cultures and to enjoy the natural wonders of the Earth.
			</p>
			<br>

				I got accepted into TJ via the direct school admission (DSA) programme, through choir. Now I must admit, it was not my intention to use choir to get DSA to TJ. 
				In fact, I actually intended to use leadership and join the Student Council (due to my rich amount of leadership experiences gained from being the president of 
				a student leadership group back in my secondary school. Long story short, leadership was my first choice, and choir second (because I was in my secondary school's 
				choir and felt that there was no harm in adding it in too), but due to reasons unknown to me I only received a response from the TJ Choir, and ended up accepting 
				a DSA offer from them.
